# Parcel delineation
This is an [openEO](https://openeo.org/) example for delineating agricultural parcels based on a neural network, using Sentinel-2 input data.

The example focuses on the inference step, using a trained model. It demonstrates data loading and preprocessing, 
inference, and finally producing vector data as a result.

The example serves as a technology demonstration for openEO, and is not intended for use in another context.

## Running the example

Most openEO providers require an account to run the example. They offer various options for this, often providing you with some trial to test out the platform.
You can find all known openEO providers on the [openEO hub](https://hub.openeo.org/).
